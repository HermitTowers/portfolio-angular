# PortfolioAngular

## Intro
This is my online portfolio. It is an example of my coding style.
I have included a service that pulls the git Read Me for the project.
This uses a simple data object built using the json string that is returned from GIT.
There are some 'fancy' UI elements as well.


#Notes
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.4.
