# PortfolioAngular

## Intro
This is the code for the site at jldunsmore.com.<br>
I have included a service that pulls the git Read Me for the project.
This uses a simple data object built using the json string that is returned from GIT.
There are some 'fancy' UI elements as well.
This is also a but 'off' in that all the components are on one page with no routing. I plan to 
fix that in another round of coding.

## Notes
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.4.
