        <p>
            I have been a Web Developer and Programmer since 1997 and have worked as both full time and as a contractor.
            Those very different environments have given me many different skills and
            experiences. With contracting, I learned how to adapt. Every company has their own way of doing things and in a
            short time I need to fit in and be able to code. With a full time position, it
            tends to be the number of ‘hats’ that I am required to wear that becomes the challenge on top of how I fit in
            the team and the work that is required.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even with all that experience, I am not a ‘guru’. Programming, working with code, and building something
            exciting and robust can be the most fun thing and I can 'lose' hours trying to figure
            out one more coding problem. I may not know all the tricks or even all the buzzwords in the industry, but I am
            proud of my ability to adapt and use my past experience and varied skills to
            tackle any challenge, but I am not an expert in any one skill. I know a lot of things from different points of
            view. I am trying to learn new things and remember what I have forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can work alone, but I enjoy more working with a team. We can all work together and bring our individual
            skills, knowledge, and experiences together to accomplish any goal. I am most happy
            fitting in where I can do the most good. I do not need the 'lime light', nor do I need to work on 'bleeding
            edge' technologies. Don't get me wrong I LOVE new technology, but I am not in a such
            a hurry to grab on and use it that I forgot to look where I am going on a current project.
